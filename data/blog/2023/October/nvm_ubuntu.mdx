In order to easily switch node versions on the ubuntu server, we use nvm as the node version management tool on the server. The steps are as follows:

1. The server executes the installation command:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
```
2. After the installation is complete, close the current terminal window and reopen a new terminal window.

3. Run the following command to verify whether nvm is installed successfully.
```
nvm --version
```
You can see the version number of nvm

In addition, if the nvm command fails after re-opening a new terminal window after nvm is set, check whether the environment variables are set in the user file .bashrc or .bash_profile file. Examples are as follows:
```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" 
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm 
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" # This loads nvm bash_completion
```
Perform refresh configuration after setting
```
source ~/.bashrc
or
source ~/.bash_profile
```
